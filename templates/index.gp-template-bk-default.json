I have bought sprays and the little shoe scent balls, I’ve stuffed dryer sheets in my shoes. None of that worked until now….These are a decent size to take up a good amount of the shoe. The have almost a pool/chlorine smell, but not overpowering, it just smells fresh. Buying my second pair now because I want them in all my shoes regardless of how much I use the use the shoes!!!!"

My shoes do not stink at all! I’ve bought these for the past 3 years and right at a year I notice they start to lose their stink blocking abilities. But at less than $20 per year for a new pair I am not complaining!! I will keep buying them forever!"

I have never deodorizer them until I bought these and man let me tell you after just sitting 15 minutes the odor was a third of what it was. After a few hours they smelled like the leather they were made of. Amazing. They have a slightly strong chlorine odor smell to them if you put them up to your nose so I wouldn't suggest sniffing them too hard... But they are \"odor free\""

I didn’t care if it was 30degrees outside if my son dared to take his cleats off in the car on the way home from practice, I was putting the windows down because the smell from his cleats would make me nauseous. It smelt like cat pee. And we tried Everything to take the smell away and nothing worked until this product! I recommend these to everyone I talk to that has an athlete or is one."
