After a few hours they smelled like the leather they were made of. Amazing.

For shoes with heavy odor buildup, leave The Neutralizer inside for two nights for maximum effect.</li><li><strong>Do I need to keep buying refills? </strong>Not often. The Neutralizer itself is reusable for up to 3 months.</li><li><strong>What makes Dr. Odoro different from sprays or powders?</strong>                                  Sprays only mask odor with fragrance and often add moisture, making the problem worse. Powders are messy and temporary. Dr. Odoro solves odor physically, not chemically, by removing the moisture and compounds that cause it in the first place.</li></ul>",
